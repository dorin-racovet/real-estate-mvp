# 5. Epic List

Based on the PRD requirements and 1-week timeline, I recommend **3 Epics**:

| Epic | Title | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| **Epic 1** | Foundation & Authentication | Establish project infrastructure, implement auth system, and deliver basic agent property creation |
| **Epic 2** | Property Management & Admin | Complete agent dashboard with listings management and admin oversight capabilities |
| **Epic 3** | Public Experience & Polish | Deliver public listings, detail pages, favorites, and final polish |

**Rationale for 3 Epics:**
- Each epic delivers deployable, testable functionality
- Epic 1 establishes foundation + delivers first user value (agents can create properties)
- Epic 2 completes the "backend" user journeys (agent management + admin)
- Epic 3 delivers the "frontend" public experience
- Cross-cutting concerns (error handling, validation) are woven into each epic
