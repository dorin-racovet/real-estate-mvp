# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1 Overall UX Vision

Clean, modern, and professional interface that instills trust in property seekers while providing agents with an efficient workflow. The design should feel lightweight and fast, avoiding the cluttered appearance of traditional real estate portals. Emphasis on property imagery and essential information.

## 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Card-based browsing**: Properties displayed as visual cards with key info at a glance
- **Progressive disclosure**: Summary on cards, full details on dedicated pages
- **Inline actions**: Favorite heart icon directly on cards without page navigation
- **Form-centric agent experience**: Dashboard prioritizes property creation form
- **Table-based management**: Agents and admins manage listings via sortable tables

## 3.3 Core Screens and Views

**Public Views:**
1. **Home/Listings Page** - Hero section + filterable property grid
2. **Property Detail Page** - Photo gallery + full details + agent contact
3. **Favorites Page** - Grid of saved properties

**Agent Views:**
4. **Login Page** - Email/password authentication
5. **Agent Dashboard** - Property creation form + own listings table
6. **Property Edit Page** - Pre-filled form for editing existing property

**Admin Views:**
7. **Admin Dashboard** - All properties table with pagination
8. **Property Edit Page** - Same as agent but for any property

## 3.4 Accessibility

**Level:** WCAG AA compliance target

- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Alt text for all property images
- Form labels and error announcements
- Focus indicators on interactive elements

## 3.5 Branding

- **Style:** Modern, clean, professional
- **Colors:** To be defined (suggest neutral palette with accent color for CTAs)
- **Typography:** System fonts for performance, clear hierarchy
- **Imagery:** Property photos are the hero; UI should not compete

## 3.6 Target Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Desktop-first design with mobile breakpoints

- Desktop: Full feature set, multi-column layouts
- Tablet: Adapted grid layouts, touch-friendly targets
- Mobile: Single-column, hamburger menu, optimized image loading
