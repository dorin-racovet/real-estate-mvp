# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

- Deliver a fully functional real estate listing MVP within 1 week
- Enable agents to create, manage, and publish property listings with images
- Provide property seekers a frictionless browsing experience without registration
- Demonstrate clear role separation (Agent, Admin, Public)
- Validate the BMAD method for AI-assisted rapid development
- Establish foundation for future enhancements (Phase 2+)

## 1.2 Background Context

RealEstate Pro addresses the gap between complex, expensive MLS systems and overly simple DIY solutions. Independent real estate agents and small agencies need a lightweight platform to manage property listings without the overhead of enterprise systems. Simultaneously, property seekers demand frictionless browsing without forced account creation.

This MVP serves dual purposes: delivering a functional product and proving that the BMAD methodology can produce working software in a compressed timeline. The platform's role-based architecture (Agent → Admin → Public) establishes clear boundaries while maintaining simplicity.
